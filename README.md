# info and documentation
- most documentation is recorded in html and css comments.

## night mode js
- using a night mode difference switch found online. slightly modified to show a square instead of a circle. can remove if better night mode solution found. 

## mobile responsiveness
- desktop version of website is being made first
- current mobile design in template.html does not use javascript. will need to find suitable hamburger menu design if going to make specific mobile menu.
- current mobile header design simply moves the links below the name

## name/logo
- meet and decide on names/logos/any branding used.
- name and logo can be switched out or both added. html elements are simply commented out, but css rules remain in base.css.
